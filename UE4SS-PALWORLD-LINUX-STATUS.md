# UE4SS Native Linux Port — Palworld Server

## Status: WORKING — all hooks verified in-game; update-resilient (2026-08-03)

Lua mods load, `RegisterHook` works, admin commands work, players join and play
with the full hook set enabled. Server stable at 118–119 FPS.

## Update resilience (what happens when Palworld updates)

Three layers, so an update either just works or fails loudly — never a silent
mid-session crash:

1. **AOB scans** (update-robust already): ProcessEvent, PLSF,
   CallFunctionByNameWithArguments, FName ctor, StaticConstructObject,
   GUObjectArray, GMalloc are all pattern-resolved and survive recompiles.
2. **Self-healing vtable sweep** (commit `a90eb5e`): at boot, re-derives
   AActor BeginPlay/EndPlay slot offsets by consensus over all ~505
   AActor-family vtables (tick-prereq adapter anchor + Itanium header walk).
   Slots moved by an update are corrected automatically; inconclusive sweeps
   keep the hardcoded fallbacks below. Watch the boot log for
   `Palworld vtable sweep:` lines — they print old -> new offsets.
3. **Hook-target validation gate** (commit `bc51fea`): every vtable-resolved
   hook target is disassembled before detouring. Refuses only proven crash
   classes (junk target, float/int register truncation) — those log
   `REFUSED`; shape drift logs a `NOTE` and installs anyway (trampoline
   pass-through is safe for extra pointer args). After an update: check
   UE4SS.log for `REFUSED`/`NOTE` lines before joining.

Lua mods load, `RegisterHook` works, admin commands work, players join and play
with the full hook set enabled. Server stable at 118–119 FPS.

## Hook Status (config: `~/palworld-server/UE4SS-settings.ini`)

| Hook | Setting | Verified address | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| BeginPlay | `HookBeginPlay=true` | `0x9f778f0` (vtable slot `0x388`) | Working, soak-tested in-game |
| EndPlay | `HookEndPlay=true` | `0x9f64320` (slot `0x390`) | Working |
| LoadMap | `HookLoadMap=true` | `0xaa43800` (slot `0x4C0`) | Working (fires at startup) |
| InitGameState | `HookInitGameState=true` | `0xa3b5000` (slot `0x740`) | Working |
| ProcessConsoleExec | `HookProcessConsoleExec=true` | `0x7b4b5e0` (slot `0x2B8`) | Working |
| ULocalPlayerExec | `HookLocalPlayerExec=true` | via `FExecVTableOffsetInLocalPlayer` | Working |
| EngineTick | `HookEngineTick=true` (default) | `0xaa3cfe0` (slot `0x308`; baked 0x2F0 was PostExit) | Working — PR #6 + #7 (AOB fallback) |
| ProcessLocalScriptFunction | `HookProcessLocalScriptFunction=true` | AOB scan | Working — survived player join (fixed by thunk-aware JMP resolution) |
| StaticConstructObject | always on | AOB scan | Working |
| CallFunctionByNameWithArguments | `HookCallFunctionByNameWithArguments=true` | AOB scan | Working — survived player join (thunk fix) |
| UObjectProcessEvent | `HookUObjectProcessEvent=true` | `0x7b4c080` | Working — survived player join |

## Verified Palworld vtable offsets (differ from upstream 5.1 dump)

Palworld's vtables do **not** follow a uniform shift — verify per entry, never
blanket-shift. Overrides live in `deps/first/Unreal/src/UnrealInitializer.cpp`
(gated `is_palworld` block).

| Class::Function | Upstream 5.1 (baked) | Palworld-Linux | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| UObject::ProcessEvent | 0x260 | **0x268** | GDB call test (audit) |
| UObject::GetFunctionCallspace | 0x268 | **0x270** | audit |
| UObject::CallRemoteFunction | 0x270 | **0x278** | audit |
| UObject::ProcessConsoleExec | 0x278 | **0x2B8** real impl (via thunk at slot) | thunk-aware resolution; fired hooks work |
| AActor::BeginPlay | 0x380 | **0x388** | 261 vtables share `0x9f778f0` at 0x388; caller `mov %rdi,%rbx; call` (1-arg) |
| AActor::EndPlay | 0x388 | **0x390** | same sweep; wrapper callers pass `rsi` through (EndPlayReason) |
| AGameModeBase::InitGameState | 0x738 | **0x740** | six GameMode vtables hold `0xa3b5000` at 0x740; override wrapper chains into it with rdi only |
| UEngine::Tick | 0x2F0 | **0x308** (baked 0x2F0 = PostExit, silent dead hook) | PR #6: gdb call-site dispatch + runtime stack sample + GameInstance fingerprint; PR #7: 24B AOB fallback (`55 41 57 41 56 41 55 41 54 53 48 83 EC 58 49 89 FC 48 8B BF E0 09 00 00`, exactly 1 hit) for the dlsym case (Palworld strips `UGameEngine::Tick` from dynsym) |
| UEngine::LoadMap | 0x4C0 | **0x4C0 (baked)** | fires cleanly at startup; consistent across 3 UEngine vtables |

Model: AActor's own region has an extra slot before the tick-prerequisite
adapters (0x378/0x380 = RemoveTickPrerequisiteActor/Component adapters, note
`+0x28` vs `+0x30` variants). UEngine's region is NOT shifted. UObject's
ProcessEvent-and-later slots are +8. Do not generalize.

## Root Causes Found and Fixed (newest first)

### 2026-08 fix set — PRs #2-#13 (all merged upstream)

1. **FName::ToString FString leak (~300B/call)** — PR #12: the game allocates the
   FString output via its TLS-cache allocator and the fork frees via glibc → allocator
   mismatch, leak; fixed by pre-reserving the fork-owned FStringOut so the game never
   allocates. Address via Lua scan override (`UE4SS_Signatures/FName_ToString.lua`,
   `return 0x7945dd0`). GMalloc-based free is structurally impossible (no vtable Free).
2. **GUI console default** — PR #13: shipped settings now default `GuiConsoleEnabled=0`
   (DebuggingGUI::setup SIGSEGV on headless servers, issue #1 Crash 1).
3. **ForEachUObject walk amputated the live world** — PR #10: 4-chunk 262k cap +
   EInternalObjectFlags==0 skip removed (zero flags is the live-object steady state).
4. **Sticky-atomic hook gates + adaptive async sleep** — PR #9 (engine_tick_hook self
   0.04% after; fewer wakeups).
5. **Allocation-free crash handler** — PR #8: old handler allocated inside itself and
   deadlocked the game thread on heap-corruption crashes (the "signal 0 + empty dump"
   saga); new handler = static buffers + snprintf + raw write + fork()-writer.
6. **AOB fallback for UGameEngine::Tick** — PR #7 (dlsym fails on stripped dynsym).
7. **UEngine::Tick slot 0x308** — PR #6 (baked 0x2F0 was PostExit — silent dead hook).
8. **Lifecycle-hook deadlock** — PR #5: 13 unconditional hooks took the Lua mutex on
   the game thread while the async thread held it through its 5ms sleep; any actor
   spawn/despawn (join/leave) wedged the game thread. Empty-callback early returns +
   sleep moved outside the lock + 13 sticky atomic flags.
9. **KSL name** — PR #3: `KismetSystemLibrary` (UE5.1) not `KismetStringLibrary` (UE4).
10. **Walk address filters** — PR #4: 0x7e-0x7f range check rejected every object on
    non-PIE binaries (heap at 0x73-0x7c; compiler folds to range-length form).
11. **SettingsManager never throws** — PR #2: `std::stoll` on empty
    `[EngineVersionOverride]` aborted through libsteam_api's broken
    `__gxx_personality_v0`; C-style non-throwing parsing.

### Lua error handling on a multi-runtime process

PalServer exports its own statically-linked C++ runtime (`__cxa_throw` etc.),
and libsteam_api.so exports aborting crash-handler variants; both resolve
before LD_PRELOAD entries in symbol scope order. Proven consequences:

- Lua-internal errors (luaD_throw) threw through libsteam_api's `__cxa_throw`
  → `abort()`. **Fix:** `LUA_USE_LONGJMP` keeps Lua error propagation inside
  Lua's own setjmp/longjmp design (as upstream does on Windows).
- C++ exceptions thrown from libUE4SS code (e.g.
  `LuaMadeSimple::Lua::call_function` on an unprotected mod error) could not
  be caught reliably either: the raise/personality/unwinder mixed runtimes
  (`_Unwind_SetGR.cold` abort, `get_adjusted_ptr` SEGV), and with all EH + std
  typeinfo symbols privatized via `-static-libstdc++` + a version script, the
  runtime_error vtable still interposed (virtual `what()` jumped to garbage).
  **Fix:** no C++ exceptions as error transport across the
  LuaMadeSimple→LuaMod seam — use `call_function_report` (returns the error
  as a value). `LuaMod::process_delayed_actions` uses it; unprotected mod
  errors now log `[DelayedAction] ...` with a Lua traceback and the server
  survives.

**Hard rules that follow (do not regress these):**
1. Lua-internal error propagation stays on longjmp — do not define away
   `LUA_USE_LONGJMP`.
2. No `throw` out of any Lua callback path executed inside hook executors —
   report errors as values.
3. `-Bsymbolic-functions` is NOT usable here (breaks `__dynamic_cast`'s
   cross-library typeinfo semantics); symbol interposition for std-type
   vtables between exe and preload cannot be fully controlled.

### Lua thread safety — process-wide recursive lock

Mod Lua states are `lua_newthread` coroutines sharing ONE global_State per
mod, touched by: the game thread (detour/script hooks), each mod's
`update_async` thread, and the main thread (start/stop/reload). The port had
partial `m_thread_actions_mutex` coverage; `execute_hook`,
`process_delayed_actions`, and most `on_program_start` callback lambdas were
unguarded. **Fix:** all Lua entry channels now hold that recursive mutex.
Zero FPS impact measured under a dual-thread Lua churn soak (LuaStress mod).
Deadlock rule respected: never block while holding it (nobody does — there
are no waits/futures in LuaMod), and `uninstall()` still stops the async
thread BEFORE taking it.

### Thunk-aware JMP resolution (ASMHelper) — fixed PLSF join freeze
**File:** `deps/first/ASMHelper/src/ASMHelper.cpp`
`RESOLVE_JMP` previously stopped at the first instruction; a 2-instruction stub
(`xor %r8d,%r8d; jmp <real>`) was returned as the hook target. Now follows jmp
thunks (including mid-function ones) to the real implementation. ProcessConsoleExec
`0x44d0020 → 0x7b4b5e0`, and ProcessLocalScriptFunction now detours the real
function — the old behavior (detour on a stub) is the likely cause of the
deterministic join freeze at ~90% (2026-07-28 09:24 boot). PLSF re-verified
working after the fix.

### Palworld vtable slot verification & overrides
**File:** `deps/first/Unreal/src/UnrealInitializer.cpp`
AActor BeginPlay/EndPlay, AGameModeBase InitGameState overrides (table above).
Verification method (reusable after updates): anchor vtables in the binary via
the shared tick-adapter thunk (`0x9f5cc80`, slot 0x380) or a known function,
read candidate slots, disassemble targets, and check caller argument setup
(`rdi`-only vs `rdi+rsi`).

### FName `_N` suffix Number parsing
**Files:** `deps/first/Unreal/src/NameTypes.cpp`, `UE4SS/src/LuaType/LuaFName.cpp`
The engine's find-or-add parses `Name_N` suffixes and returns the BASE name's
ComparisonIndex; we must replicate the parse and set `FName.Number = N` (default
was 0 — wrong for e.g. `BountyProof_1`). New Lua overload
`FName(string, integer Number, EFindName)`.

### Lua SIGABRT on mod errors
**Commit:** `c1b0bd5` — use `longjmp` instead of C++ exceptions across Lua.

### Limited-mode crashes
**Commit:** `f9f18e7`; Default__Object lookup + ProcessEvent hook init: `0e2a3f4`.

### Earlier fixes (kept from previous revision)
1. `Function::reset_address()` missing `m_is_ready=false` — stale ready flag.
2. `FName(StringViewType)` now null-terminates before find-or-add.
3. GMalloc heuristic: main-exe writable segments + BSS only, vtable[2] must be `31 C0 C3`.
4. FMalloc vtable +8 shift (extra no-op slot) — Malloc 0x18, TryMalloc 0x20, Realloc 0x28, TryRealloc 0x30, Free 0x38.
5. `FMemory::Malloc/Realloc/Free` use system allocator on Linux (FMallocBinned2 TLS cache unsafe from UE4SS init context).
6. GUObjectArray chunked access (6 chunks × 65536 × 24-byte items) + SIGSEGV recovery on stale pointers.
7. PalworldNameProvider::FindName wired to engine find-or-add `0x7941c10` (AOB).

## Landmines / What To Watch Out For

- **`VTableLayout.ini` (server dir) CANNOT fix wrong offsets.** The loader uses
  `emplace()` — insert-only, existing keys win. Baked/generated offsets always
  beat the ini. Correct place: the `is_palworld` block in
  `UnrealInitializer.cpp`.
- **Deploy atomically:** `cp libUE4SS.so libUE4SS.so.new && mv libUE4SS.so.new libUE4SS.so`.
  A plain `cp` over the live `.so` while the server runs corrupts the mapping.
- **Crash signature reading:**
  - SIGSEGV inside GUObjectArray accessor with a garbage index → a hook registry/
    index corrupted earlier by a wrong detour (six-hook boot symptom).
  - Detour receives denormal float (~9e-39) + bool=64 → wrong slot: real fn is
    `(ptr, i64, ptr)`-shaped; the truncation kills a pointer → crash deep in callee.
  - SIGSEGV `[rsi+8]` inside libUE4SS after a vtable hook → detour signature
    mismatch; Lua callback marshaled a garbage `this`/param.
  - `rip` in `0x7f...` range = inside libUE4SS/trampolines; low `0x0...` = game binary.
- **After any Palworld update:** boot once and read `UE4SS.log` BEFORE
  joining. `vtable sweep` lines confirm BeginPlay/EndPlay self-corrected;
  `validation REFUSED` lines mean a hook was left disabled (compare against
  the hook table, re-derive that slot via the binary method, update the
  fallback in `UnrealInitializer.cpp`); `validation NOTE` lines mean a hook
  installed despite shape drift — play-test that hook's behavior.
  UObject/InitGameState/LoadMap/Tick offsets are NOT swept: if their NOTE/
  REFUSED lines appear, re-derive manually (method below).
- **The port hooks PLSF/CFBNWA-relevant script dispatch via the standard
  TDetourInstance path; mods using `RegisterHook` on UFunctions rely on it.**
  If joins freeze at ~90% again, suspect these first — but do NOT blanket-disable;
  capture the stalled game thread with `gdb -p <pid> -batch -ex "thread apply all bt 8"`.
- **Stripped binary:** no symbols; every address in this doc is for the current
  `PalServer-Linux-Shipping` build and WILL move on update.
- **Never exercised in production:** C++ `.so` mod loading via `dlopen` (implemented in CppMod.cpp,
  but no C++ mod has been load-tested), `ProcessInternal` hook
  (unresolvable on stripped binaries — PLSF covers the mods that use it).
  (Headless GUI is no longer a gap: the shipped default is `GuiConsoleEnabled=0`
  — the GLFW setup SIGSEGVs headless, PR #13.)
